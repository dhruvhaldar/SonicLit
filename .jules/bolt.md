## 2024-05-24 - Polynomial Array Factorization Optimization
**Learning:** Refactoring polynomial expressions on NumPy arrays (like cubic splines) to combine scalar multipliers (e.g. `w * (1.0/6.0)`) and group terms to avoid redundant temporary negative arrays (e.g. replacing `-w_sq + w` with positive groupings) avoids intermediate memory allocations and negation ops, yielding a significant (~25%) speedup in array-heavy code.
**Action:** Always inspect polynomial calculations inside performance-critical loops to mathematically factorize terms to use positive evaluations and group constants.
